    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Srivardhini K, a highly motivated student currently pursuing my Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Coimbatore Institute of Technology (2023‚Äì2028).

With a strong interest in cutting-edge technologies, I‚Äôm passionate about exploring how AI can solve real-world problems. I enjoy learning new tools, experimenting with ideas, and collaborating with peers to grow both technically and creatively.

I actively participate in hackathons, idea competitions, and tech events to expand my perspective and stay current with industry trends. I also take initiative in self-learning beyond the classroom, constantly pushing myself to improve in areas like coding, system design, and data thinking.

Outside academics, I enjoy communicating about AI topics and have had the unique opportunity to speak on All India Radio about the future of AI in space. I value curiosity, consistency, and the power of continuous improvement.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div class="project">
    <h3>Text Summarization using Hugging Face API</h3>
    <p>
    Built an AI-powered web application that summarizes long text inputs into concise and meaningful summaries.
    Integrated Hugging Face's transformer models via API and developed a clean, responsive UI using React.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> React.js, JavaScript, Hugging Face API, CSS</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Deployed a fully functional tool for generating readable summaries ‚Äî useful for students, researchers, and content creators.</p>
    <a href="https://ai-note-summarizer-n8w9.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Live Demo</a>
  </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Fraud Detection in UPI</h3>
      <p>Developed a data-driven fraud detection model for UPI payment transactions. Applied dimensionality reduction using PCA and trained logistic regression to identify suspicious behavior patterns based on transaction volume and value trends. Focused on improving early anomaly detection without explicit fraud labels.

Tech Used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

Outcome: Enabled effective flagging of potential fraudulent patterns in monthly customer-initiated UPI transactions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Portfolio Management System</h3>
      <p>Created a dynamic web platform that allows users to manage and track their financial investments. Implemented CRUD operations for assets, real-time portfolio summaries, and visualizations of returns using PHP and MySQL.

Tech Used: MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Outcome: Provided users with an easy-to-use financial dashboard to monitor stocks, mutual funds, and SIP performance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Career Path Recommender</h3>
      <p>Designed an intelligent system that recommends career paths by analyzing user interests, skills, and work style preferences. Used cosine similarity to match user profiles with occupational datasets and return personalized job roles and insights.

Tech Used: Python, pandas, NLP, cosine similarity

Outcome: Helped students identify suitable AI/Tech career paths along with the required skills and job outlooks.</p>
